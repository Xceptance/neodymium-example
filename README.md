# Introduction
This repository demonstrates how to use our [[Neodymium library|https://github.com/Xceptance/neodymium-library]] to set up a maintainable and well structured test automation project. Furthermore we use the [[Wiki|https://github.com/Xceptance/neodymium-template/wiki]] on this project to show and explain how to use the features from the Neodymiun library. We also give insight how we think a test automation project should be structured and what results you should get out of it.

# Template
If you like our ideas and you would like to start a test automation project using the Neodymium library. We prepared a template that can be used as "Hello World" tutorial and is a good starting point for your own project.
